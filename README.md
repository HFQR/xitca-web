# Quick Start ⚡

> For a list of other examples, see: [**Examples**](examples)

To get started using Xitca-web add the following code to your `main.rs` file: 
```rust
use xitca_web::{handler::handler_service, middleware::Logger, route::get, App};

async fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello world!!"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    App::new()
        .at("/", get(handler_service(index)))
        .enclosed(Logger::new())
        .serve()
        .bind("localhost:8080")?
        .run()
        .await
}
```

And then add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
xitca-web = { version = "*" , features = ["logger"]}
tokio = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["full"] }
```

And then run the application/server using `cargo run` command and it should start the server/application on <http://127.0.0.1:8080>. Open your prefered browser and navigate to the address on which the server has started and you should see a `hello world!!` message appear.

> [!Warning]
> The project is still not stable. So expect breaking changes to appear at any time.

# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) 🗨️

## Why Yet Another HTTP Framework?

The primary reason behind creating Xitca-web is to have more memory safe HTTP framework which uses 100% safe rust unlike HTTP frameworks like actix-web which heavily rely upon unsafe rust code. As well as to provide a framework with low-memory footprint and with very small dependency tree.
