# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) 🗨️

## Why Yet Another HTTP Framework?

The primary reason behind creating Xitca-web is to have more memory safe HTTP framework which uses 100% safe rust unlike HTTP frameworks like actix-web which heavily rely upon unsafe rust code. As well as to provide a framework with low-memory footprint and with very small dependency tree.
